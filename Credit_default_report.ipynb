    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent advances in digital technology and big data have allowed FinTech (financial technology) lending to emerge as a potentially promising solution to reduce the cost of credit and increase financial inclusion. FinTech credit has the potential to enhance financial inclusion and outperform traditional credit scoring by (1) leveraging nontraditional data sources to improve the assessment of the borrowerâ€™s track record; (2) appraising collateral value; (3) forecasting income prospects; and (4) predicting changes in general conditions. However, because of the central role of data in ML-based analysis, data relevance should be ensured, especially in situations when a deep structural change occurs, when borrowers could counterfeit certain indicators, and when agency problems arising from information asymmetry could not be resolved. (IMF 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "Student debt has been one of the sectors that have grown exponentially with the addition of more FinTechs to the market willing to fund young people's education. Student loan debt is now the second highest consumer debt category - behind only mortgage debt - and higher than both credit cards and auto loans. In 2019 there were more than 44 million borrowers who collectively owed USD 1.5 trillion in student loan debt in the U.S. alone. The average student in the Class of 2016 has USD 37,172 in student loan debt. (CNBC, 2020)\n",

    "</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is important to increase the inclusion of capital to fund education, it is as equally important to ensure that every loan is allocated to individuals who will have the financial capacity to repay the debt in the future without substantially affecting their well-being. Student loans FinTechs, probably more than any other type, rely on the ability to forecast the situation in which borrowers will be in the long term future. While other types of loans, such as business loans or mortgages, can confidently use past information to accurately predict the future, student loans are one of the investments that can change an individual's future. If a Business gets a loan to fund a project, there is probably a project evaluation with future cashflow estimations, and most likely, the remaining operations of the business will remain relatively consistent. Similarly, after the 2008 mortgage crisis, mortgage loans have been more carefully allocated to individuals who are already financially settled. Student loans, on the other hand, represent the adventures of young people that will navigate over the next few years, in some cases moving to new cities or even countries, drastically changing their set of skills and critical thinking, and exponentially increasing the potential level of income they can now access. Only by considering the fact that the difference between traditional loan approvals and the first payment is of 1-3 months, and for student loans can be as long as 4 years, it is not difficult to understand the additional complexity that evaluating a student loan represents. In addition, to the complexity in prediciting a very dynamic future, the terms of this predictions for student loans are typically of 10-15 years, compared to terms of 1-5 years for digital business loans. \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, student loan FinTechs face the challenge of predicting a future that will probably look significantly different from the past, and of doing so for a very long period of time.\n",

    "Knowing the complexity of the challenge, it is crucial to leverage every piece of information that FinTechs can get access to, and that is what this project is all about. Stride is a FinTech company that competes in the student loan market, and its mission is to make education affordable and accessible. To achieve this mission, Stride is in constant search of ways to improve the quality of the methods used to evaluate risks. Recently, the Stride Funding Credit team gained access to a promising set of data for predicting loan defaults. Unfortunately, the complete documentation of the data was lost while renewing the internal database structure. However, it wouldn't be wise to just discard such a valuable piece of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to assess the potential of this data and obtain as much insight as possible that could be useful to improve Stride's operations. To achieve the purpose, the following specific objectives were achieved: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform a deep exploratory data analysis process to understand as much of the data as possible. \n",
    "- Clean the data. \n",
    "- Produce a model that can help identify loans at risk of default.\n",
    "- Predict a set of data that has no information on the default status.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - H1: Scores are collected from different credit reporting institutions: It is difficult to test this hypothesis since the three main credit institutions use similar ranges. Equifax -> 250-850;  Experian -> 300-850;  Transunion -> 300-850\n",
    "\n",
    "    - H2: Scores are collected at different moments in time: It could be the case that one of the scores was taken before the loan was disbursed and the other at some specific point during the duration of the loan. In this case, the difference would represent the evolution of the credit performance of the client. If this were the case, it will be assumed that *score1* was collected before *score2*. \n",

    "\n",
    "If we were to build a model to be used before the underwriting process, it will be useful to consider the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Potential sources for these variables are shown inside parenthesis)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of loans with stride(internal data): It is safe to assume that if a client has already performed well in a loan with Stride the probability of a default in additional credits. In my experience, only 7% of repeat clients defaulted on their subsequent loans. Since the description of the data mentioned that each observation represented a client, it was assumed that no individual had repeated loans, but it would be something worth looking into.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loan terms of the loan (internal data): Knowing the general characteristics of the loans is crucial when explaining why someone defaulted. It might be the case that the amount was higher than he was able to pay the interest rate could have been too expensive, if the term was too long, you face issues such as potential deaths or accidents. Adding variables such as loan_amount, interest_rate, and term would allow control for this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initial date (internal_data): As mentioned before, this dataset is ambiguous about when was all the information collected. Adding an initial date of the loan would allow us to derive information such as the age of the client when hiring, and control for environmental effects such as a recession in the economy, or in his working sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information about the program to attend (require acceptance letter during the application): Following the reasoning above, knowing more information about the program that the client intends to attend would allow predicting with more precision information such as grad_income (Income after graduation), sector where he could work and school where the program will be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GPA (require transcripts of previous academic levels and follow-up after graduation): Track the academic performance of the client would help to know his potential future job opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gym membership (ask during application): A phenomenon that I studied in my previous position was the relationship between payment behavior and subscriptions, especially for people without a credit record. The hypothesis was that subscriptions represent a similar situation as that of a loan in terms of requiring a periodic payment. While most subscriptions such as streaming services and cellphone plans were not significant, having a gym membership was significant. The reasoning behind this fact is behavioral. In simple terms, having a gym membership can be used as an instrumental variable of \"level of responsibility\", as not only does it require to be periodically paid, but also implies that (in most cases) the individual attends the gym on a regular base, which impacts many branches such as health condition (less likely that they could die or get sick) and self-esteem. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Loan percentage repaid (internal data): We can divide the process to underwrite a loan into two main phases. On one hand, the origination phase contains all the processes done before disbursing the loan (promotion, credit processing, risk analysis). On the other hand, the collections phase contains all the actions done after the disbursing. With this in my mind, there are only two reasons why a loan can be incorrectly approved. Either the loan was incorrectly approved from the beginning, in this case, we have an origination issue, or the loan was correctly approved but something went wrong afterward, in this case, we have a collections issue. A FinTech needs to know where are the defaulters coming from. The percentage of the loan that was paid is a great indicator to evaluate that. In general, loans that default over the first 20% of the payments imply a higher origination responsibility. If the loan defaults after that, for example after paying 80% of the debt, most likely the origination process was adequate, and the issue came from a collections perspective."
